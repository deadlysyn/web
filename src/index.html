        <div class="block">I am a humbly opinionated and collaborative engineer with a growth mindset. Designing, delivering and maintaining development tooling and infrastructure services at scale for three decades has equipped me with a wide range of expertise as an individual contributor, technical lead, architect, consultant and hands-on manager.</div>
        <div class="block">While engineering is a technical discipline, I believe nurturing creativity is essential to meaningful progress. Building a culture of trust and autonomy while guiding intuitive insights through experimentation supported by the scientific method is paramount both to success and quality of life.</div>
        <div class="block">Breadth of knowledge is no excuse for lack of depth. There is a time to move fast, and a time to slow down. To borrow a proverb, "Vision without action is a daydream, action without vision is a nightmare." Flow and deep work are not buzzwords. Our craft needs more thoughtful reflection, more consideration of context, more awareness of impact... To end with another proverb, "don't be so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you forget to think if you should."</div>

performance and essential for mental health. Google’s famous quest for the
perfect team (Project Aristotle) empirically led to psychological safety
as the number one trait of healthy teams. Here are three observations from a
30-year career that may be undermining psychological safety on your team:</p><h2 id=implicit-vs-explicit-norms>Implicit vs Explicit Norms</h2><p>If you have expected norms around behavior, communication, work style, etc.
that are implicit vs explicit, they threaten psychological safety. As you
scale, it will be difficult and anxiety-ridden for everyone to remain on the
same page when &ldquo;the page&rdquo; is in your heads.</p><p>&ldquo;Smart people will figure it out&rdquo; doesn’t work in teams with healthy levels of
diversity (hopefully you’re not just hiring people who think like you to build
an echo chamber; a topic in itself). Everyone will figure out a different way,
and waste precious mental energy doing so!</p><p>The solution does not need to be draconian. A lightweight solution I’ve seen
work well is the Agile Team Working Agreement. Have a team discussion, capture
expected norms, and treat it as a living document which is reviewed and revised
as needed. Now agreed norms can be easily referenced, encouraging
accountability without wasting time and inducing stress.</p><h2 id=lack-of-test-environments>Lack of Test Environments</h2><p>We often joke about moving fast and breaking things, but most businesses want
us to move fast without breaking things. As imperfect beings in an
increasingly complex world, the only realistic way to accomplish that is
building discipline around how we test.</p><p>Depending on your context, this may be a full-fledged &ldquo;production-like&rdquo;
environment to build confidence or a few containers running on a laptop. What
you do not want is no agreed strategy or every engineer reinventing the wheel.
Similar to above, each engineer will approach the challenge differently. It’s
inefficient, potentially unsafe, and undermines psychological safety.</p><p>Treat test environments like any other part of the product; standardize,
document, automate and continuously refine! That means having them in version
control, and owning them as a team to avoid the infamous &ldquo;worked on my machine.&rdquo;</p><h2 id=unclear-expectations>Unclear Expectations</h2><p>I’ve worked in shops where every sub-task was micromanaged, and coming out of
those it felt like a breath of fresh air to have less defined tasks. Most
engineers enjoy a certain amount of creative freedom vs. having implementation
details dictated.</p><p>That said, the other end of the spectrum is equally undesirable. For example,
if you lack clear acceptance criteria, have no definition of done, don’t
estimate stories, and don’t use due dates while silently expecting tasks to
move at some implicitly understood pace; such ambiguity threatens psychological
safety and will ultimately impact the team’s mental health.</p><p>This can be partially addressed through a healthy Agile Team Working Agreement,
but also requires deliberate attention to how work is planned. Some loathe
estimates, and I have seen those done in ways that added questionable value.
Done well, they can be lightweight and serve as a mechanism for teams to better
understand complexity. More than a specific practice, clearly and consistently
communicating expectations is key.</p><p>As an explicit example of what to avoid: tickets without meaningful priority
or due dates when management has internal expectations around delivery times.
Putting in the effort to make expectations explicit and clear improves
performance and protects psychological safety.</p><p>What are some of your favorite techniques to maintain psychological safety and
safeguard your team’s mental health?</p></div></section></body></html>

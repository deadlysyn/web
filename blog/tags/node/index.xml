This is going to be another multi-part series&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get too far ahead of myself, but the end goal is shipping a Node.js app using Amazon Web Service&amp;rsquo;s Elastic Container Service (ECS). We have to crawl before we can walk (or run an app), so this first article will cover the basics of getting a simple Node app containerized (feel free to plug in whatever app you want).</description></item><item><title>Node Health Checks</title><link>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/node-health-checks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/node-health-checks/</guid><description>Cloud Foundry (CF) has a concept of health checks. These can take a few forms, but the preferred approach is HTTP (vs port- or process-based checks). Applications can expose a /healthcheck endpoint which the Cloud Controller polls. If an application becomes unhealthy (indicated by non-200 HTTP status code), restarts are attempted.
There is a health check timeout which I like to think of as the startup timeout. During initial startup of the application, the health check process will wait this long (polling every couple seconds) for the app to become healthy.</description></item></channel></rss>

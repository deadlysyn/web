These can take a few forms, but the preferred approach is HTTP (vs port- or process-based checks). Applications can expose a /healthcheck endpoint which the Cloud Controller polls. If an application becomes unhealthy (indicated by non-200 HTTP status code), restarts are attempted.
There is a health check timeout which I like to think of as the startup timeout. During initial startup of the application, the health check process will wait this long (polling every couple seconds) for the app to become healthy.</description></item></channel></rss>

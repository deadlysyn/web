Similarly, the SRE mindset seeks to eliminate toil. We also know from experience that the most effective Agile teams are granted a high level of autonomy.
IAM is a routine stumbling block to autonomy. Teams need an &amp;ldquo;appropriate&amp;rdquo; level of access to do their job. That often turns into waiting on tickets, with another team twiddling bits to unblock development.</description></item><item><title>Go Datadog CLI</title><link>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/go-datadog-cli/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/go-datadog-cli/</guid><description>I found myself wrapping ChatOps around a CI/CD pipeline to manage scheduled downtime in DataDog (avoiding SLO impact for planned work). For astute readers wondering why this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a direct API call; I tend to (ab)use CI as a generic task runner (has an API, secret store, etc).
I wanted to identify resources using labels (team:foo, service:bar). While this is a common use case and things have hopefully improved, CLIs available at the time provided numerous ways to manage downtime but lacked tag support.</description></item></channel></rss>

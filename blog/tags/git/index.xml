Some times they are simple, but in social contexts it is easy to forget how a little time taken to be intentional can help others (or ourselves) in the future.
One example of this I encounter almost daily is git commit messages. Often you will see one-liners such as &amp;ldquo;fixed typo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;squashed bug&amp;rdquo; â€“ most likely meaningful enough to the person who just spent hours tracking down the typo or figuring out how to fix the bug.</description></item></channel></rss>

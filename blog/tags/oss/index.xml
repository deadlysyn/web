Similarly, the SRE mindset seeks to eliminate toil. We also know from experience that the most effective Agile teams are granted a high level of autonomy.
IAM is a routine stumbling block to autonomy. Teams need an &amp;ldquo;appropriate&amp;rdquo; level of access to do their job. That often turns into waiting on tickets, with another team twiddling bits to unblock development.</description></item><item><title>AWS WAF Module</title><link>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/aws-waf-module/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/aws-waf-module/</guid><description>NOTE: This includes AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet by default, which AWS updated to mitigate the recent Log4j issue (CVE-2021-44228).
Just released a Terraform module for AWS WAF. If you host &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; web services (atop something Linux-like), this takes an opinionated approach to save you time while providing enough flexibility for common use cases.
module &amp;#34;waf&amp;#34; { source = &amp;#34;git::ssh://git@github.com/sonatype/terraform-aws-waf.git?ref=v0.0.1&amp;#34; association_arns = [module.foo.alb_arn] environment = var.environment name = var.name namespace = var.namespace tags = var.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Retriever</title><link>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/retriever/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/retriever/</guid><description>The AWS SDK is great. Writing boilerplate for simple tasks is&amp;hellip; Well, you have better things to do.
Whether creating CLIs or services, one task I routinely encounter is secrets management. With AWS, I might use Secrets Manager (advanced features such as versioning simplify programmatic rotation) or Parameter Store (cost savings at scale, works great for injecting container environment).
I find myself repeating boilerplate (load configuration, create client, retrieve secret):</description></item><item><title>Go Datadog CLI</title><link>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/go-datadog-cli/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/go-datadog-cli/</guid><description>I found myself wrapping ChatOps around a CI/CD pipeline to manage scheduled downtime in DataDog (avoiding SLO impact for planned work). For astute readers wondering why this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a direct API call; I tend to (ab)use CI as a generic task runner (has an API, secret store, etc).
I wanted to identify resources using labels (team:foo, service:bar). While this is a common use case and things have hopefully improved, CLIs available at the time provided numerous ways to manage downtime but lacked tag support.</description></item><item><title>Keycloak IaC</title><link>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/keycloak_iac/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://deadlysyn.com/blog/posts/keycloak_iac/</guid><description>Keycloak is a flexible, open source, identify access and management solution (Red Hat SSO being the commercial variant). While there is a growing community, much information is focused on service integration.
After Terraforming supporting infrastructure, I wanted to share a &amp;ldquo;batteries included&amp;rdquo; project to quickly get anyone adopting Keycloak up and running. If you already use Keycloak, it may provide inspiration. If you find it lacking, please help extend it for the greater good.</description></item></channel></rss>
